            <h1>375 Rent Reduction</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first land policy was "375 Rent Reduction" When Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the landlords who owned a lot of land could decide who could rent the area (demand was high, but the land belonged to a small group of people) because of the overpopulation. The tenant had to give all the crops to the seeds, except for the seed part. In the event of a natural disaster or crop failure, they are still required to provide all the rent to the landlord. In the past, the rent was called "iron rent", which meant that their rights were not protected, and even if they did not have enough rights, they still had to give up everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first land policy was to change this situation. In April 1949, Taiwan's President Chen Cheng announced a new land policy, the "Reduced Arable Land Rent Act of 37.5%". It reduced the 50% rent by 25%, resulting in the following formula：
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                50% x (1-0.25) = 37.5%
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Landlords are not allowed to charge rent for land in advance. If the crop fails, then the rent should be lower.</li>
                    <li>The rental contract shall be for a period of not less than six years.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the contract, if the landlord does not intend to bring it back for homesteading, he/she should rent it to the tenant.</li>
                    <li>If the landlord plans to sell the land, the tenant has priority in buying it.</li>
                    <li>Every town needs to establish a rent association to deal with land disputes or controversies.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Public Land Release</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                The following policy is "Sale of Public Land". According to the report of the National Development Council of Taiwan, public land in Taiwan is land owned by the Japanese government, private companies and individuals. The land area is approximately 1,760 square kilometers. From 1951 to 1976, the R.O.C. government conducted nine sales of public land transactions. The price of the land was 2.5 times the annual rice production of the land. People had to pay the price through crops or cash for ten years. The purpose of this policy was to make the people self-sufficient. The policy has benefited 28.8627 million households and the land sold is 1397570000 square meters.

            <h1>Land cultivation program</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                In 1953, two years after the "sale of public lands," the R.O.C. government announced a new land policy called the "land cultivation program. This policy allowed landlords to keep only a portion of their land, which the government then took and distributed to people. Landlords received some compensation from the government, including stock in government-owned companies.
