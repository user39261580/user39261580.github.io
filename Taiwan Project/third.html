                    The first policy is the "Rice - Fertilizer Barter Program". This policy was "rice in exchange for fertilizer". Farmers could not buy any fertilizer themselves; instead, the government controlled 100% of the fertilizer; the only source of fertilizer was the government. The exchange rate was 1.5 kg of fertilizer: 1 kg of rice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By implementing this policy, the government has achieved some positive results. According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, the following are the results.
                    <ol>
                        <li>The government reduced the income of farmers, and since the income of the industry was relatively high, farmers in rural areas and women from their families came to the factories. It increased the labor supply.</li>
                        <li>By doing so, the government controls the rice on the market, so they can control the price of rice and bring it down. The price of rice has become more stable.</li>
                        <li>The government bought rice at a lower price and then they used the money to pay government workers, teachers and soldiers.</li>
                    </ol>

                    The R.O.C. government set up many protective measures for Taiwan's "immature industries" so that Taiwan could develop products with low technology requirements, low investment, high labor force, and national needs. 1. restrict the import of food, soap, clothing, and other items. 2. raise import tariffs. 3. lower export tariffs. The purpose of all these policies was to encourage "light industry" to produce for Taiwan's needs. According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, by 1954, there were no textile imports, and by 1957, the cement industry was producing enough to stop importing any cement.

                    After "import substitution", there are many reasons to take the next step. According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, there are more than a million people on farms who need work because of the great advances in agricultural production technology. Also, since 1958, the demand within Taiwan is too small and the factories are producing more than the demand, so they need to sell their products overseas. On the other hand, the government also encouraged other countries to invest in Taiwan, and in September 1960, the government announced the Investment Encouragement Ordinance, reduced export tariffs, and established the Export Processing Zone. This unique area attracted investors to build factories and then export their products to the rest of the world, hence the term "export-oriented" development.679/5000 Export Processing Zones are an important current development. The Taiwanese government has created a special zone in the seaport and encouraged investors to build factories, thereby reducing export tariffs, rents, etc. The Export Processing Zone is the first export processing zone in the world. The Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone is the first of its kind in the world. Products produced in this zone are not subject to duty until they are exported. The great success of the EPZ in Taiwan has brought many job opportunities. Kaohsiung is today the second largest city in Taiwan. The Port of Kaohsiung is also the largest port in Taiwan.
