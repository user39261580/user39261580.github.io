                    Taiwan is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, the island is home to a diverse group of people, including Fujianese, Hakka, Chinese from other provinces, Taiwanese aborigines and Southeast Asian immigrants. Before World War II, Taiwan was a Japanese colony, and in 1895, China gave Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan as a result of the defeat in the First War against Japan. After World War II, the ROC government moved to Taiwan and began building the island. When the ROC government arrived in Taiwan in 1949, nearly 2 million soldiers and their families also moved to Taiwan. When the R.O.C. government arrived in Taiwan, there were many things that needed to be resolved, and when World War II ended in 1945, the economic and health conditions in Taiwan were very low. The R.O.C. government had a major impact on the development of Taiwan, transforming the economic entity from agriculture to high-tech industries. Between the 1960s and 1980s, a series of serious new policies and development programs industrialized Taiwan. Taiwan's National Bureau of Statistics indicated that GDP per capita was $229 in 1965, and 30 years later, it increased to $3,225 in 1984.

                    When the R.O.C. government arrived in Taiwan, one of the first things they did was a series of land policies. First, they changed the Act to reduce the connection with the Chinese Act system, and then they issued the Taiwan dollar. Then they established many rules for the farmers so that they could be self-sufficient. The second step to improve the economic situation was to develop "light industry". The government began to help build small factories to produce textiles, shoes, and paper. This helped prepare Taiwan for the shift to "heavy industry". In order to stimulate investment, the government encouraged investors from all over the world to establish factories in Taiwan's ports. This is the third step in the development. The site will discuss what is happening in Taiwan, the policies and changes in Taiwan and who is helping and making all these things work.
